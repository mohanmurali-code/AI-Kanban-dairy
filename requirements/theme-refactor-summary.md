# AI-Kanban-dairy Theme Refactor & Features Summary

**Document generated on:** August 14, 2025

---

## 1. Theme System Implementation

- Multiple theme CSS files created for each layout image (e.g., `dark-dashboard.css`, `light-simple.css`, etc.).
- Dynamic theme switching in `App.tsx` using a dropdown and localStorage for persistence.
- All theme CSS files imported and scoped with theme classes (e.g., `.theme-dark-dashboard`).
- Theme standards and checklist documented in `requirements/themes/README.md`.

## 2. Component Refactoring for Theme Compliance

- All major UI components (e.g., `TaskCard`, `TaskCreationModal`) refactored to use theme classes and CSS variables.
- Removed hardcoded colors, borders, and backgrounds.
- Added optional `className` prop for easy theme extension.
- Ensured all form fields, buttons, and cards use theme classes.

### Example: Before/After

**TaskCreationModal Button Before:**

```tsx
<button className="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600 transition-colors">...</button>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<button className="theme-modal-close">...</button>
```

**TaskCard Before:**

```tsx
<div className="rounded-md border bg-white p-3 shadow">...</div>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<div className="theme-card-bg theme-card-border theme-card-shadow rounded-md">...</div>
```

## 3. Pages Refactoring (In Progress)

- Identified all page components (`Kanban`, `Themes`, `Tasks`, `Settings`, `Notes`, `Layouts`) for refactoring.
- Recommendations for replacing utility classes and inline styles with theme classes.

**Kanban Button Before:**

```tsx
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500">+ New Task</button>
```

**After (Recommended):**

```tsx
<button className="theme-btn-primary">+ New Task</button>
```

## 4. Documentation & Standards

- Theme system, CSS file details, and compliance checklist documented in `requirements/themes/README.md`.
- Standards for future components: use theme classes, CSS variables, and avoid hardcoded styles.

## 5. Debugging & Error Fixes

- Fixed JSX structure and syntax errors in `TaskCreationModal`.
- Ensured all modal and form elements are properly nested and closed.

## 6. Next Steps & Recommendations

- Refactor all page components to use theme classes and variables.
- Remove all remaining hardcoded colors, borders, and backgrounds.
- Extend theme system to support custom accent colors, fonts, and layout options.
- Continue updating documentation as new features and standards are added.
