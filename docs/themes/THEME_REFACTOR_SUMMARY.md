### 2. **New Theme Files Created**

#### Modern Minimal Theme (`modern-minimal.css`)
- Clean, contemporary design with subtle shadows
- Light theme with indigo accent colors
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Professional appearance suitable for business use

#### Dark Elegant Theme (`dark-elegant.css`)

### 5. **Migration Utilities (`utils/themeMigration.ts`)**
- Automated migration from legacy theme formats
- Validation of required CSS variables
- Batch migration capabilities
- Error handling and reporting
- Configuration generation
