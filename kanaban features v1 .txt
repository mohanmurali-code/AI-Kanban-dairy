below is draft requirement please improvise add your ideas Application name: kanban Personal Dairy Features: 1. kanban Tab: Description: This tab has a button to add new task. Tasks have 4 status. each task is dispalyed in a card style. cards have 4 different fields. to store information. Purpose: the kanban view is handly place to quickly monitor the satus of each tasks. User Flow : There 4 diffrent stages. Draft, Refined, Inprogress, completed, Blocked. Technical Requirements: The cards information is stored in a json format in local stoarge of laptop. And retrived from it as weel. Add options to select the folder to store the data in json format. Acceptance Criteria: the cards are dragg and drop style, the status should be updated accordingly. 2. Draft Notes: This is content editable html kind note pad where all the rough work is drafted. 3.settings tab: for application settings. 4. Themes tab to change the application looks 5. Task view Tab where all the tasks are listed. options to add new tasks.



I’m going to turn your draft into a concise, production-ready PRD, resolve inconsistencies (e.g., 4 vs 5 statuses), fill gaps, and add practical implementation ideas that keep it simple to build but pleasant to use.
Product name
Kanban Personal Diary
Goals
Quick, visual personal task management with a free-form drafting space.
100% local-first; user controls where data lives (JSON files).
Fast, simple, distraction-free; works offline.
Core features
Kanban Board (drag-and-drop, 5 statuses)
Draft Notes (content-editable scratchpad)
Task List view (table)
Themes (appearance)
Settings (data location, app preferences)
Personas
Individual knowledge worker/student managing personal tasks and notes.
Works on a single device (desktop-first), no team collaboration.
Platform options
Option A (recommended): Desktop app via Electron or Tauri for reliable folder access, notifications, and backups.
Option B: Web app/PWA using the File System Access API for choosing a folder (best on Chromium-based browsers). Fallback to IndexedDB if unsupported.
Information architecture
Tabs: Kanban | Draft Notes | Tasks | Themes | Settings
Global search/quick switcher (Ctrl/Cmd+K) across tasks and note titles.
Kanban board
Columns (default, editable): Draft, Refined, In Progress, Blocked, Completed.
Card fields (default 4, customizable): Title, Description, Due Date, Priority. Optional: Tags.
Interactions:
Drag-and-drop across columns updates status and persists immediately.
Keyboard DnD: move card with arrow keys + modifier; Enter to open quick edit.
Multi-select: Shift-click for range; Ctrl/Cmd-click for toggles; drag as group.
Quick add in each column; inline edit for Title/Priority.
WIP limit per column (optional).
Blocked cards show reason chip; hover for details.
Draft Notes
Content-editable rich text with minimal toolbar (bold, italic, headings, lists, checkbox list).
Markdown shortcuts (e.g., “- ” for list, “# ” for heading).
Slash commands: /todo, /date, /task to link or create tasks.
Autosave, word count, session restore.
Optional templates (Daily Note, Meeting Notes).
Link tasks with @task or #tags; click opens card.
Task List view
Table with columns: Title, Status, Priority, Due Date, Tags.
Sort, filter (by status, due date, priority, tags, text), bulk actions.
Quick add, inline edit of cells.
Export filtered list to CSV.
Themes
Light, Dark, System; High-contrast variant.
Accent color picker.
Font size scale (S/M/L).
Optional reduced motion.
Settings
Data location: Select folder to store JSON (and backups). Show path; change anytime with migration.
Backups: Daily rolling backups (keep last N), one-click restore.
Import/Export: JSON export/import (full or tasks-only).
Columns: Customize order, names, colors, WIP limits; add/remove columns (map to internal statuses or custom).
Notifications: Due soon/overdue via OS notifications (if desktop) or browser notifications (if web).
Security: Optional password; local encryption of on-disk files.
Non-functional requirements
Performance: <50ms card move; <200ms board load with 2,000 tasks.
Reliability: Autosave within 1s; atomic writes with temp files and fs rename.
Offline-first: All features work without internet.
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA, full keyboard support, ARIA roles for list/drag-and-drop, color contrast.
Internationalization-ready; date/time locale aware.
Data model (JSON)
Task
Settings
Storage layout (when user selects a folder)
tasks.jsonl — newline-delimited JSON for append-only writes; periodic compaction into tasks.compacted.json
notes.md or notes.json — current Draft Notes content
settings.json
backups/YYYY-MM-DD/.json(.zip)
log.txt (optional for diagnostics)
Local cache: IndexedDB for fast reads; background sync to disk folder.
Schema/versioning:
settings.json includes schemaVersion.
On version change, run migration before UI is interactive.
Encryption (optional):
AES-GCM with key derived from user password (Argon2id or PBKDF2).
Key kept in-memory only; no plaintext key on disk.
Drag-and-drop acceptance criteria
Given a task in column A, when it is dragged to column B, then:
Status persists to storage within 1s.
Card stays in B after app reload.
Undo (Ctrl/Cmd+Z) reverts the move.
Keyboard users can move the focused card across columns.
Multi-select: moving multiple cards updates all statuses; failures are reported and none are lost.
Blocked: moving into Blocked prompts for reason (skippable), shows reason chip.
Draft Notes acceptance criteria
Typing autosaves within 1s of idle.
Closing/reopening app restores last content position.
Markdown shortcuts convert to formatting.
/task opens task picker; selecting one inserts a link that opens the card.
Data location acceptance criteria
User can pick a folder; app writes files there even after restart.
Changing folder migrates data and updates path.
If folder is unavailable, app prompts to choose a new one or use local cache; no data loss.
Manual backup and restore succeed and are validated.
Task List acceptance criteria
Sorting and filtering apply instantly to visible rows.
Inline edits persist and reflect on the Kanban view immediately.
Exported CSV matches current filters.
Themes acceptance criteria
Theme changes apply instantly and persist across restarts.
High-contrast theme meets contrast ratios.
Keyboard shortcuts (discoverable via a help modal)
Global: Ctrl/Cmd+K (search), Ctrl/Cmd+N (new task), Ctrl/Cmd+/ (shortcuts help)
Board: Enter (quick edit), Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow (move), Shift+Arrow (multi-select)
Notes: Ctrl/Cmd+B/I/U, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L (toggle checklist)
Technology proposal
UI: React + TypeScript + Vite
State: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
Drag & Drop: dnd-kit (great keyboard DnD)
Rich text: Tiptap (Markdown shortcuts) or Slate
Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for theming
Desktop: Tauri (small footprint, Windows-friendly) or Electron
Storage:
Desktop: direct filesystem access to user-selected folder
Web: File System Access API + IndexedDB fallback
Milestones
M1: Skeleton app (tabs, routing, settings, theme, simple storage)
M2: Kanban MVP (drag/drop, inline edit, persistence)
M3: Draft Notes (rich editor, autosave, slash commands)
M4: Task List (table, filters, CSV export)
M5: Data location, backups, import/export, migration
M6: Accessibility pass, keyboard DnD, performance tuning
M7: Optional encryption + OS notifications
Risks and mitigations
File writes corruption: use temp-file + atomic rename, JSON schema validation, backups.
Web folder access support: prefer desktop build; in web, detect support and fall back to IndexedDB + manual export.
Large single JSON file: use JSONL with periodic compaction; or chunk by month.
Would you like me to:
Generate a clickable wireframe outline for the Kanban board and Notes?
Produce TypeScript interfaces and the storage service skeleton?
Start a Tauri project scaffold with the folder layout above?
Implemented a complete PRD with clarified statuses (5), card fields, and robust local-first storage.
Added themes, backups, encryption, accessibility, keyboard DnD, JSONL compaction, and import/export.
Proposed tech stack and milestones to start building immediately.
